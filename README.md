# Thesis Demo: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for AI-driven Digital Transformation

This repository contains the implementation of a thesis project titled 
**"A Study of How the IT Department Strategically Utilizes Artificial Intelligence to Facilitate Internal Digital Transformation"**. 
The project showcases the application of AI technologies such as OCR, image recognition, and RAG to enhance enterprise digital transformation.

## Project Overview

This notebook demonstrates:
1. **PDF Processing**: Extracting text and images from PDF files using OCR and image recognition techniques.
2. **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Utilizing a pre-trained AI model to answer user queries based on extracted information.
3. **Integration and Results**: A seamless pipeline combining text/image extraction and RAG to deliver precise responses.

## Key Features

- **OCR and Image Recognition**: Extracts data from multi-modal PDF files.
- **AI Model Integration**: Leverages advanced AI APIs for natural language understanding and response generation.
- **Application Focus**: Demonstrates potential use cases in IT-driven digital transformation.

## Prerequisites

Before running the notebook, ensure the following dependencies are installed:

- Python 3.8+
- `pdf2image` for PDF processing
- `PyTorch` or similar deep learning frameworks
- Any API keys required for the pre-trained RAG model

Use the following command to install the necessary libraries:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone [repository-url]
   cd [repository-folder]
   ```

2. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Thesis_final_rag_demo.ipynb
   ```

3. Follow the steps in the notebook to process PDF files and interact with the RAG model.

## Output

The notebook outputs responses to user queries based on the content of processed PDF files. The results demonstrate the effective integration of AI technologies in enterprise workflows.

## Future Work

- Enhancements to the RAG model for domain-specific queries.
- Integration with enterprise systems like ERP for automated data processing and storage.
- Expanding multi-modal capabilities for more complex document types.
